# GIPHY UI PROJECT

- The UX is learnt from YouTube, there are 2 pages for the whole project. The default page is used for displaying trending GIFs, once the user input some search key and press 'ENTER', the page will be redicted to the search(results) page, the search key is contained in its URL as a query parameter.
- The infinity Scroll is implemented by 'react-infinity-scroller'
- Besides react-router I use to fetch data on the default page, I do also have experiences on react-query/redux RTK to fetch/mutate data through calling APIs.
- Some todos have been Commanded in the codes.
